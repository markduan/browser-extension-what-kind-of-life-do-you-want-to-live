This extension inspired by [Death Focus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aanjfkjcndemihgneohhjicnaahlphbm), and the name is from Hayao Miyazaki's movie.

Life is short, you should cherish every minute and every second. Go out and have fun, take a walk, learn something new, cook a delicious meal, and work hard to create a better life for your family. Don't waste your time on meaningless things.

Ask yourself: What kind of life do you want to live?
